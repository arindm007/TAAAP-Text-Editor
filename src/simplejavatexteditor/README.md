# TAAAP-Java-GUI-Text_Editor

This includes features such as:

Search tool (to search text/keywords easily in the code) + highlighting the text found.

Find/Replace text/code.

Auto completion for Java and C++ keywords (files need to be saved as .java/.cpp). It can be easily expanded to support pretty much any number of languages.

Drag and Drop (drag files into the text area and they get loaded).

Nice image buttons for better UX.
